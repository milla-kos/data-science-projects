# Machine Learning Projects
  1. nuclear-atypia: Nuclear Atypia Scoring in Breast Cancer Histological Images Using Transfer Learning
     - Using convolutional neural network and transfer learning to classify breast cancer histological images based on nuclear atypia.
     - create_dataset.py file uses the frames and atypia scores stored in 'raw_data' folder to construct the final dataset to be used as input to the CNN.
     - documentation.pdf file presents the project report with details about used methods and project conclusions.
  2. IBD-classifier: Machine Learning to Aid Diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Using Metagenomic Data
     - Classifying healthy individuals and IBD patients using metagenomic data and three classifiers.
     - The folder includes create_dataset.py and load_data.R files that show how the dataset was constructed. The dataset is from curatedMetagenomicData R-package [1].
     - The final dataset is stored in 'data' folder.
